        "This project focuses on performing an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the vast catalog of TV shows and movies available on Amazon Prime Video in the United States.\n",
        "Leveraging two structured datasets—\n",
        "titles.csv, which includes metadata such as title type (TV show or movie), release year, runtime, genres, and IMDb ratings, and\n",
        "credits.csv, which details cast and crew information—the goal of this analysis is to uncover meaningful patterns, trends, and insights that highlight how content is distributed and consumed on the platform.\n",
        "The analysis began with thorough data cleaning, including removing duplicates, handling missing values, and properly parsing list-like fields such as genres and production countries. From there, we explored the overall distribution of content types and discovered that movies significantly outnumber TV shows on the platform. Genre analysis revealed Drama, Comedy, and Action as the most frequently occurring genres across both formats, suggesting viewer preference and platform focus. We also analyzed release trends over time and observed a steady rise in content production and acquisition, particularly after 2010, reflecting Amazon’s growing investment in original programming and global licensing. When examining IMDb ratings, we found that most content scores fall within the 5 to 8 range, with relatively few extremely high- or low-rated entries. Runtime analysis showed that movies typically cluster around 90 to 120 minutes, while TV shows vary more significantly, often depending on the number of seasons. The cast and crew dataset was used to identify the most frequently appearing actors and directors, giving insight into recurring talent and perhaps content that resonates more with audiences. By combining all these findings, this project offers a data-driven understanding of the type of content Amazon Prime prioritizes, how it has evolved over time, and which attributes might influence popularity or viewer engagement. These insights can be valuable not only for viewers or data enthusiasts, but also for content strategists and business teams at Amazon seeking to align their offerings with audience demand and market trends. Ultimately, this analysis demonstrates the power of exploratory data work in drawing actionable insights from a streaming service's content library."

        "In the age of digital streaming, understanding what drives viewer engagement is more critical than ever. Through this exploratory data analysis of Amazon Prime Video’s content catalog, we've taken a deep dive into the platform’s backbone—its shows and movies. Starting with raw metadata and cast information, this project unraveled meaningful trends in content type distribution, genre dominance, ratings, runtime, and the frequency of key contributors like actors and directors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our findings show that movies far outnumber TV shows, indicating a platform-wide leaning toward shorter-form content. Genres like Drama, Comedy, and Action consistently emerged as the most common, likely reflecting both audience preferences and industry production trends. Release year patterns highlight a sharp rise in content after 2010, coinciding with Amazon's strategic expansion into original programming. Meanwhile, IMDb ratings remained concentrated in the moderate range, suggesting a consistent quality baseline across titles.\n",

        "By combining these insights, we move beyond surface-level statistics to reveal how Amazon Prime curates its catalog, what types of content dominate the platform, and where future opportunities might lie. This analysis equips decision-makers with a clearer picture of viewer preferences, helping to guide smarter content acquisition, investment, and recommendation strategies.\n",
